# Marcom BSI Information System

## Abstract

The Marketing and Communication (Marcom) division of Bina Sarana Informatika Foundation (BSI) aims to introduce and establish the image of the educational products of Bina Sarana Informatika University to the public. Marcom BSI has over 50 employees who can submit requests for goods to support this goal. The process of archiving goods data and managing employee data in Marcom BSI still relies on Microsoft Excel managed by administration. This leads to outdated employee data since only administration can modify data, and the history of incoming and outgoing goods is not well recorded because only the final data is saved.

Therefore, Marcom BSI needs an information system that can facilitate managing the archiving of employee data and goods data. Data collection techniques in this research include observation, interviews, and literature study. The waterfall method is chosen as the software development model, while for design, it uses UML (Unified Modeling Language), ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram), and LRS (Logical Record Structure). Black-box testing is conducted to ensure that the program's functions, logic, and output meet user needs.

In this research, the program is developed using PHP programming language with Laravel framework to create a web-based system for archiving goods data and employee data in Marcom BSI.
